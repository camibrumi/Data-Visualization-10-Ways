- a bit tricky when debugging the python programs (everything is a syntax error)
- easy and fast to make the first version of the scatterplot
- fast interpreter of the dataset
- I did a hack in order to get the sizes of the points. I was checking when a weight on the table was >= 4000, then I added to the array of sizes the size 200, when it was between 3000 and 4000, then I would add a size of 100 for that point, and the same thing with the weights <= 3000.
- I had to do many if-else cases in order to get the colors and the sizes of the points.

R + ggplot
I used the RStudio ide
really easy to add a file, I did not have to do any for/while loops,
I could do a complex scatterplot with only 4 lines of code!
very easy to manipulate the data you want to represent!
