- a bit tricky when debugging the python programs (everything is a syntax error)
- easy and fast to make the first version of the scatterplot
- fast interpreter of the dataset

R + ggplot
I used the RStudio ide
really easy to add a file, I did not have to do any for/while loops,
I could do a complex scatterplot with only 4 lines of code!
very easy to manipulate the data you want to represent!
